# Some utilities that might be useful if you are using RandomUniqueId. This file needs to be explicitely included:
#
#   require "random_unique_id/util"
module RandomUniqueId::Util
  # Set the initial automatic ids on the database (also known as sequences) to a higher number than 1. The reason to use
  # this is in case you want to test for id leakage in HTML. For example, you create a blog post, display it, and search
  # the HTML for the id of the blog post, author, featured image, and so on. If these ids are low, like 1 or 10, the
  # likelihood of false positives is very high, but if they are larger numbers, like 10001, then it becomes very
  # unlikely (but not impossible).
  #
  # @param [Hash] options
  # @option options [Boolean] :verbose whether to print messages to the console about what's going on or not.
  # @option options [Integer] :initial_id initial id at which the sequences will be set.
